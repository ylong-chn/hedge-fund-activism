# hedge-fund-activism

The data collection process for hedge fund activism (HFA) has been found challenging due to the following difficaulties: 

- Downloading of SC 13D forms, which is large in volume and varies in file types;
- Extraction of relevant information from a SC 13D form, which requires text mining;
- Matching subject names from SC 13D forms to ticker symbols to perform stock analysis;
- Acquiring stock data for all target firms. 

We collect HFA data in the following way: 
- SC 13D forms are downloaded from SEC, parsed, and stored in local database. Code is adapted from Schwartz-Ziv & Volkova (2021).
- Then ticker symbols are matched to CIK on 13D filings with `sec-cik-mapper`.
- Next, identify *hedge fund* filers using information from WhaleWisdom.com.
- Stock prices are retrieved from Yahoo Finance using R package `quantmod`.
- S&P 500 returns are used for calculation of abnormal returns.
